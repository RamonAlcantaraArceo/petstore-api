## [0.1.1-rc4] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- `GET /api/v1/pet/findByStatus`: `status` query parameter is now optional;
  omitting it returns all pets regardless of status. Pagination via `skip`
  (offset, default 0) and `limit` (max 100, default unlimited) query
  parameters is now supported.

## [0.1.1-rc2 and 0.1.1-rc3]
### Added
- Dependabot configuration to automatically update GitHub Actions, Python (pip), and Docker base image dependencies on a weekly schedule.
- Added automatic dev deployment after GHCR image publication by invoking the reusable Fly.io dev workflow with the same image tag.

### Changed
- Updated the release workflow to mark GitHub releases as pre-releases when the tag contains a hyphen (for example, `v0.1.1-rc1`).
- Updated the GHCR image workflow to expose the produced tag as a job output.
- Updated the deployment documentation to reflect the new automatic dev deployment and the ability to specify versions for manual deployments.

### Changed
- Switched project versioning to Hatchling VCS with Git tags as the release source of truth.
- Added tag-triggered Python artifact release workflow and aligned GHCR publishing to `v*` tags.
- Release continuity note: the first stable release tag after this migration should be `v0.2.0`.
